Before running the scrapper.ipynb file, you need to add file in this directory and their names in the scrapper.ipynb file.

please use appropriate input and output file names. Please make sure to specify these file names correctly.

The input file should have a specific format. 
It should contain two columns: company_name and company_domain, where company_domain is the URL of the company. 
The entire sheet will only contain these two columns and their respective data.

In the file, you will be prompted to provide your LinkedIn username and password as well.

please update data in the scrapper.ipynb file as :
# Usage
username = "username@linkedin.com" # linkedin username
password = "linkedin@linkedin" # linkedin password
input_file = 'test_input_file.csv' # column name -> company_name, company_domain
output_file = 'test_output_file.csv' # no need for columns, it will be created automatically

and

input_file = 'test_output_file.csv' # please make sure to add the same name as you gave for the outputfile above

By running the scrapper.ipynb notebook, a complete web automation web scraper will execute and open your Chrome browser. 
Please ensure that you have Chrome installed on your system. 

After logging in, you will be prompted to to add any input in the scraper.ipynb file just hit any input and then see the magic :)
